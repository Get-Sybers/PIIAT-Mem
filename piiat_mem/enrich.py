"""Enrichment — resolve process-context links and inherit properties (epic #1).

Implements docs/design/car-store.md §3 over the normalized events of ONE run:

- **process → parent**: candidates are processes whose `pid` == the child's
  `ppid` and whose create time is <= the child's; the latest such wins. PID is
  reused by the OS, so this is a **heuristic** link (a definitive link needs the
  parent `_EPROCESS` pointer, which the plugin does not walk yet).
- **spoke → owning process**: two tiers. The piiat.* family plugins emit the
  owning `_EPROCESS` offset (`OwnerOffset`) — joining on it is **definitive**
  (the kernel's own pointer, immune to PID reuse). Where only a PID is
  available (built-in plugins, freed owners), the (pid, create-time window)
  join applies and stays **heuristic**.
- **inheritance**: a linked event inherits its process context — but only
  properties the object HAS in the CAR model, and only where its own value is
  null. A natively-supplied value is never overwritten.
- **host identity**: hostname/fqdn from the image's OWN registry
  (ComputerName + Tcpip Hostname/Domain/DhcpDomain) applied to every event
  whose object carries those fields — the whole image is one host. A flow's
  src_hostname/src_fqdn get the same (src = the local endpoint by the
  documented convention).
- **registry user via ProfileList**: a registry event on a SID-form user hive
  (``\\REGISTRY\\USER\\S-1-5-...``) resolves `user` through the image's OWN
  SOFTWARE-hive ProfileList mapping (SID -> ProfileImagePath basename) — the
  same-image artefact join, never a guess. File-path hives
  (``...\\Users\\<name>\\NTUSER.DAT``, ``ServiceProfiles\\<name>\\``) are
  handled at normalize time.
- **link_confidence**: "definitive" when the join key was an object identity
  (reserved for future offset-carrying spokes), "heuristic" for PID-window
  joins, null where no link was made.

Also dedupes events that describe the same object instance:
- `user_session` — windows.sessions emits one row per process in a session; the
  session logs in once. Rows collapse to one event per session guid (earliest
  create time), and the collapsed rows first feed a pid→user index used to fill
  `process.user`.
- exact (object, guid, action) duplicates across plugins — the row with the most
  populated properties wins. Flow/socket guids are the protocol+endpoint tuple
  (not the scan offset, which differs between netscan's physical and netstat's
  virtual view and is shared by dual-stack twins), so the same socket seen by
  both plugins genuinely collapses and v4/v6 twins genuinely don't.

Everything is grouped by `source_image`: joins never cross images.
